# About me:

**Senior Backend Developer** - Python | Django | AWS

I build backend systems that need to work reliably at scale. My experience spans 
healthcare data processing, payment integrations, LLM platforms, and microservices 
architecture.

## What I Work On

**Backend Systems & APIs**
Building and maintaining production APIs, microservices, and data processing pipelines. 
I focus on code quality, test coverage, and documentation so systems can be maintained 
and scaled over time.

**Integration Platforms**
Connecting third-party services - payment processors, CRMs, cloud infrastructure, 
databases. I handle authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and the details 
that make integrations robust.

**System Architecture**
Designing backend systems for specific business needs - understanding trade-offs 
between speed, cost, and maintainability. Clean architecture principles, separation 
of concerns, and planning for change.

**DevOps & Infrastructure**
AWS deployments, Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines. Infrastructure as code, 
monitoring, logging, and the operational side of keeping systems running.

## Technical Stack

**Core Expertise**
Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI) • PostgreSQL • AWS • Docker • Git

**Backend Development**
SQLAlchemy • Django REST Framework • Async programming • Test-driven development
Microservices • Clean architecture • API design

**Cloud & DevOps**  
AWS (ECS, Lambda, RDS, S3, SQS) • Kubernetes • Terraform • Jenkins • GitHub Actions

**Integrations**
Stripe & payment processing • CRM APIs (Salesforce, HubSpot) • OAuth & SSO
LLM platforms • Vector databases • Real-time data streaming

## Domain Experience

- **Healthcare:** HIPAA-compliant systems, PBM marketplaces, patient data processing
- **Fintech:** Payment gateways, ACH processing, PCI compliance, tokenization
- **AI/ML:** LLM integration, RAG patterns, vector databases, MCP connections
- **E-commerce:** High-traffic platforms, inventory systems, checkout flows

## Open Source Projects

Pinned below - production systems I've built:

**Construbot** - SaaS platform for construction companies to manage contracts and 
create milestone reports for client billing. Django, AWS ECS, Stripe integration.

**Radargas** - IoT platform for monitoring propane tank levels. Sensor devices + 
backend API + mobile app. GeoDjango, AWS IoT Core, Lambda functions.

## Work Approach

I prioritize understanding the actual problem before writing code. This means asking 
questions about use cases, user flows, and business constraints. I document architecture 
decisions, write tests, and create READMEs so other developers can work with the code.

When integrating third-party services, I read their documentation thoroughly, understand 
rate limits and error cases, and implement proper retry logic and monitoring.

## Professional Background

Currently working on:
- LLM integration platform (RAIA.live) - connecting 25+ third-party services
- Healthcare data processing (Truveris) - HIPAA-compliant microservices  
- E-commerce platforms - 300K unique users/month, payment processing

Previous experience includes payment integrations, insurance marketplaces, video 
conferencing systems, and real-time sports betting platforms.
